Description:

The purpose of this website is to provide information on various topics such as search optimization  , online reputation and social media marketing. The website is informative and with links to access different sections of the website.

This idea was to refactor the code to allow the website to be accessibility. Therefore, i added semantic elements such as header , footer, main, section , article and aside. This allows the website to be section the way it needed to be but also use the right html format.
